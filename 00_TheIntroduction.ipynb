    "__Disclaimer__: While the book provides recommendations, what is covered in this talk are not exactly recommendations. They are meant to more so demonstrate the possiblities of Python for better or for worse. By knowing of these things we may easier be able to debug tough issues, or pull off the most impossible hacks to save the day at the final hour.\n",
